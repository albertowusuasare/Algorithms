 This question asks to mimic algorithmically how the popular paint fill function works.
 
 Procedure : paintFill
 Parameters : Colors , a two dimensional array representing the colors of each pixel.
 	            x, the horizontal coordinate for the desired pixel
 	            y, the vertical coordinate for the desired pixel
 	            ncolor, the new color to change to 
Produces : true, if fill is successful
           false if fill is not sucessful
           
           
  Idea:
  =====
  -> Go to the pixel in question. Retrieve its color. Color ocolor = colors [y][x]
  -> If the color at that pixel is the new color, do nothing. Else change the color of the 
     desired pixel to the new color
 	 
 	 if(oColor == nColor)
 	    return false;
 	  Call some recursive helper function that will now change all the pixels of the old
 	  color to the new one
 	  
 	  
 	  
 	  //base case : if the cordinates are within the bounds of the image
 	  
 	  if(current pixel == the oColor)
 	     change current pixel to the new color
 	     Repeat for upper pixel
 	     Repeat for lower pixel
 	     Repeat for pixel to the left
 	     Repeat for pixel to the right
 	     
 	  return true
